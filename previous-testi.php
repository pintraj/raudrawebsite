            <p>I feel very fortunate that i got opportunity to attend Ravula Sir's classes. My undergraduate college was below average and now I am studying in the best college of India. The whole credit goes to Ravula. He is more like guide than a teacher to me. GATE is about both knowledge of basic concepts in CS and confidence (which people generally lack of till exam). Ravula sir did perfect job in boosting my confidence, which eventually helped me in getting AIR 8. I wish i could attend more of his sessions for other subjects not related to GATE as well.</p>

            <p>A fantastic Teacher, Engineer and Human Being. Mr. Ravindrababu Ravula is certainly one of the best teachers I have had the good fortune of interacting with. Apart from a superb hold over the various topics across the spectrum of Computer science, he possesses excellent public speaking skills and is a true motivation mill. His classes are exuberant, and have a more session like flavour, giving students ample time to think on their own, something I feel is extremely conducive in developing a good understanding of the subject matter. (I don't remember anyone dozing off even during longest of his lectures). I know many students who started believing in themselves after attending his classes and went on to achieve goals they never thought were within their grasp. Interacting with him has always been a pleasure and I hope I will benefit from his association for days to come.</p>

            <p>Wow!!! It feels great to write testimonial for you. 1 year before, I was reading the testimonial and thinking that they are now toppers, it’s not my thing. But after watching your free demo lectures on you tube, the way you approach the concept and your motivation I could not stop myself by enrolling at your coaching. And now after 1 year its AIR 13, that is also in the final year itself. Sir you are the only teacher of whom I watched all lectures (not skipped a single one) and some of them twice . My day used to start with your lecture and end with your smile (sometime you taught me in my dreams also). Now I will be the student of best department of best college in the India, and that is possible only because of you. Thanks a lot for changing my life. You are really a Gabbar sir, I will always be a biggest fan of you.</p>

Truly speaking, when I joined classes for GATE, I planned to get good rank so that I may get some IIT, but your motivation changed my life which inspired me to do more than getting a good rank and getting admitted in IITs. As a result I got 21st rank in GATE and joined IISc. Whenever I think of you, I am always encouraged to do something new, innovative a nd good for human beings rather than only thinking about grades and money. I found you more as a brother than just a teacher because you have not taught me only subjects rather you taught me way of life and always helped me in my all decisions. I would like to be associated with you in all phases of my life, and would like to work with you... I have a lot to say, but can't express everything in words.</p>

            <p>Ravi is really great teacher and motivator. His lectures on what to do on 2 months before the exam, 40 days before the exam ,30 days before the exam and how to attempt the exam were useful. HIs lectures on Keep yourself motivated motivated me, every time I felt tired and bored and wanted to stop preparation. His video about Taking The Breaks is very important to every aspirant considering if I had followed it I might have not faced back pain issue I have faced. He has always been health conscious and used to take care of health of his student.I remember when he used to teach for us in classroom coaching if he felt that even single student is tired / sleepy he used used to ask all students to stand up and made us do quick workout.  His lectures are really good quality and he has made preparation easy for first time preparing students. His lectures on difficult subjects like Operating systems, Computer Networks etc. makes that subject really easy. You are doing a Great job and keep doing.</p>

But after joining Samsung, I again got frustrated, as the work quality there doesn't even match their name. So I was continuously searching on youtube and google, what to do and what not to do. In the process I found your video lectures on youtube. I watched all the compiler design lectures in one go and realized that I need such guru. and contacted you and got myself enrolled in the full video course. I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed all the lectures. It's because of those lectures that I got 70.16 marks in Gate-2015 and AIR-47. My first two digit AIR. I even switched my company and joined Adobe-Noida. Sir, I'm greatly fascinated by Science and Technology and this time influenced by you as well, want to be a researcher in future.</p>

After joining his institute, with in no time all of our friends realised how fun the learning is. It is there where I learnt everything in the correct way. It is there where we got to know that acquiring knowledge is not just learning Computer Science. Finally it is where I found myself and built my attitude. I owe him a lot because it is because of him that I am happy for what I am today...</p>

I still remember the line which he said in his first class ‘Mujhe bhi 1 chance de do, just follow what i say and i promise you good rank’. And it was hard to imagine at that time that just by following whatever he said, i would reach here- ‘IISc’ - Dream place for many but i have NOT even dreamed about it. Great teacher, motivator, mentor - does all his work with passion. Makes everything easier and interesting. Lucky to have him as a teacher. Hats off to whatever he does. -Pallavi Chugh, IISc.</p>

            <p>Finally MY journey ended with IIT KANPUR . Learned a lot and very very special thanks to my GURU Mr Ravindra babu Ravula . Apart from my 9 hour job , his online lectures really proved to be very helpful in converting the call . Getting a good rank in gate is easy but real competetion lies in converting the call where u have to be the best among the best. Most of the coaching centres dont really taught subjects keeping in mind the interviews at iit's but This man is technical god who came into my life at a very crucial moment and leave no stone unturned in his teachings to make concepts crystal clear. :)</p>

I completed my B.Tech in a local college in my state(Andhra Pradesh).I would like to say few words regarding my life . I am very much thankful to the person who is the more respectable after my parents. He is Ravindrababu Ravula, the only person who had changed my negative energy to positive energy . Now I m studying in IIT which is possible only because of his inspiration and teaching. At the time of my B.tech final year I was thinking like entering an IIT is an impossible task to me . In my first attempt I was disqualified in the GATE examination. After this incident my confidence got reduced to zero for cracking GATE. At that situation my life is full of depression and unhappy. Failure is my close friend and success is my enemy. At that phase Ravindra sir motivated a lot. With that inspiration next year I got AIR 203. Now I am studying M.Tech in IITKGP. I didn't see such a person who have passion in teaching. Not only teaching I learned so much from his teachings. Not only studies, but also about life. IMPOSSIBLE is POSIBLE if ravindra sir is there. The days when I spent with him are the most memorable days in my life. I feel he is my own brother he shows that much affection towards me. Finally I owe you a lot in my entire life. Thank you bro, for giving this wonderful life </p>

Today is very special day to me and I would like to thank the person for helping me in each and every step in my life. I am a girl who lived in a small village having no exposure to the outside world. Facing financial difficulties and health problems, I managed to get 74000 rank in EAMCET [Engineering entrance test within Andhra Pradesh] and got admission in a startup college. I never heard of IITs and NITs till my BTech 3 day, a person came to our college. He has done his Mtech in IISc Bangalore. He explained us how the life will be at IITs. His words built confidence in us, motivates us to achieve anything in life and removed the word “Impossible” from our thinking. He said, he is starting a GATE coaching institute and the very next day, I went to join his institute. I felt that everytime you speak with him, he fills his words with a lot of love. Those days were the memorable days in my life. He created such an environment, even when we don’t have classes we love to be there and enjoy. I enjoyed a lot and those were the very precious moments for me. I learned so much from his teachings, not only studies, but also about life. He says life is not but being happy and making others happy. His helping nature is incredible. For many students including me, even if they are ready to pay, he never accepted money from any of them. He says, “Things are to be used, People are to be loved”. He always says to have overconfidence, passion and be greedy to achieve success in life. After joining Mtech, I didn’t meet him, but his words always motivated me and helped me to take the right decision in my life. Today I got placed in ORACLE, my parents are very happy and proud of me. I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for helping me discover myself. Without him, I could not have been what I am now. Thank you Ravindrababu Ravula, for being instrumental in shaping my career and moulding me in to the person I am today </p>

After that I devoted my full time learning concepts from ravindra sir videos. These videos helped me understand computer science in depth and  build confidence in me. As a result, I applied for jobs, gate and ugc net and  I cracked all the three in a row. First, In january, I got the job offer from startup company with starting package of 6 lakh and co-founder of companies are ex-googlers. Second, In march, I cleared GATE with decent rank and now in April I got qualified UGC NET. These things happen to me because, I followed ravindra sir videos.</p>

Able to learn any tool or language or technology using the basics from Algo,Networks,OS,DBMS. Able to code optimally by designing my own Algorithm for any given problem. Connect to any remote servers & clients and use any protocol from command line across subnets. I can easily write multithreaded programs and can easily synchronize them. I can explain Normalization even if some one wakes me up in middle of my sleep. I can actually visualize recursion . (I think it would have taken 3 to 4 years for me to understand this). GPA in Sem 3 -- 3.85/4 ----  Sem 4 -- 4/4. I have confidence in me that i can clear interview rounds more easily.I have dedicated just 3 months of my time to just watch your videos and i was able to clearly see the difference in my confidence.

Thanks a​ ​lot for helping me and i am pretty confident that these qualities taught by you will give me an edge over other people in my professional life. I have got an offer as Associate software developer from Pearson Education and i am joining my job from Monday.</p>

            <p>Words fail me when I have to write something about you. It had been a wholesome experience to learn anything from you,the subjects vary and the depth of your knowledge is clearly envisioned in them increasing exponentially with each lecture. I am now  PHD scholar at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus only by the way you guided me to reach my goals. In comparison to the commercialised coaching of other institutes, you put stress wherever necessary rather than throwing unnecessary weights on unnecessary topics.. Most beautiful and amazing lectures of ToC, Discrete Maths, Algorithms and Databases were instrumental in helping me get a different perspective on these subjects and gaining firm foothold on them. The questions that followed tested one's ability and analytical thinking that can successfully refine the learning process.. last but not the least the words of motivation proved fruitful at right hours when the stress was at its peak.  I knew something but you helped me learn how to get to that point and honestly, noone of present day coaching in Gate are as good as yours.. the elucidation,the spontaneity,the magnanimity,the humbleness go in tandem with the rich repository of knowledge and awesome eloquence skills you possess.. I dedicate my success to you sir as my perseverance coupled with your guidance helped me find directions in life and I will borrow your help whenever I feel I lose my path.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for teaching these GATE courses so nicely, especially Computer Networks. Your Computer Network Lectures helped me so much. Just now, I got placed in CISCO as a Network Consultant Engineer(NCE) in Bangalore with 12 LPA. I did 6 months thesis last year in Network Security. I just followed your lectures blindly & the result is: I've sent my work for a European Journal for publication. I am attaching first two pages of my thesis report with this mail. Please, read the second paragraph of Acknowledgement. How can I miss my loving teacher Ravindra Sir in Acknowledgement. I am telling about these two things: CISCO placement & Thesis work not to show off, but I just want to thank you with the core of my heart for touching my life through your video lectures. At some point of time in life, I would like to touch your feet. You are my Guru who helped me so much. I think, this email of mine might have given you joy and satisfaction.</p>

Inspired me to look into myself, look for the potential inside me, my passion. Whatever you taught me just penetrated inside me and made me crack CISCO SYSTEMS( A Dream ) The way you taught me networks was incredible. You are the one who made my interest in networking. Moreover you helped me in being a more energetic person “the morning person”. I never looked beyond your notes and they are like a life savor. Your thoughts act like blessings for others.</p>

            <p>Ravindra babu ravula, is the name when it just come to my mind, I get charged with the power of 440Watt. Dear Sir, you are the person who taught me and many of other people who came in contact with you, the way how to live a great life with good moral values. I met with many good teachers in my life but you are the one to whom I can call the great teacher(THE MASTER). Many people in this world you find advising others to do some good but they don’t tell how to do it, when do it and if any obstacle come in the way how to overcome but Sir you gave me each answer and cleared all doubts which stop a person to star his/her pursuit. I feel honored that I met you, got a chance to learn things from you. Its been complete one year and still I feel the line you said on the first day we met “If there is nothing worth you can die for, there is nothing worth you can live for”. You teach everything about life aim, education, ethics, love . I never saw a person with so much energy. I heard about the Dalai Lama that when He goes through somewhere a kind of positive energy flows in that place, I don’t feel less than that about you. You are always ready to help people. You are a good friend and a great Master. I can write a book on you that kind of person you are and surely I am gonna do this. Last but not the least all can say is that” you are a game changer “. Guys I can bet with you on the first day you will become fan. The way of teaching and listening to the problems of everyone and taking steps to change society and always motivating people to do so makes you an extraordinary man. I hearty feel that I am so lucky that I got a Master like you in my life. Thanx for being a true friend and master,,,J:- Pradeep Pannu, Thapar University.</p>

One fine day, I saw MY GURU RAVI sir on youtube. Then my life started. He is god of computer science, the way he teaches, even a small guy can understand it. Even after having less result, I got into a dream company just because of Ravi sir. I took online coaching from sir. I got placed in 2 companies Tecnotree(core) and Oracle(dream). Now i am working in oracle as a application developer just because of him. I started following what ever he used to tell me. I took a scan copy of his photo and pasted in my room, daily i used to see him and get inspired. Now he became a part of my life. Still i didn't get a chance to meet him. I dedicate my success to him. He is my god.</p>

            <p>Ravi Sir, well, a lot to tell about him- He is an awesome lecturer who sentences concepts in an easy way so as to make his students feel interesting about the subject. His class will never be boring because he just not goofs up wid theory, rather teaches u in an practical manner. We always feel that he is one among us who is teaching .We eagerly wait for his next class,such an enthusiastic person he is. He is very illuminative and spends his most of the time with students. Desire, Believe and Enjoy is his mantra. Rather than a Lecturer, we find him as our IDOL and follow him. If you have any problem, he is always there for u. Apart from all these, He is very handsome :D He is complete amass of a perfect person :) Thats why, we all love and respect him.ThankYou sir for everything. Whatever I am till now, I owe to u.</p>

I started taking his online classes in Febraury 2015 and I topped in DBMS and Computer networks in the college just because of those classes. And I have got placed in ‘Deloitte’ , the first company to have come in the campus , again because of him. Now I am looking forward to score a very good rank in GATE. So I would say my career took a significant direction since I started with his classes. I owe him everything </p>

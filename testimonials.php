I watched a couple of his Networking lectures and was awed by the way he had made everything seem so simple and interesting. At that very moment I decided to opt for his full course. His knowledge, dedication and hard work reflect in his videos as they are really good in content. They help you prepare not only for GATE but also in general, develop an interest in the field of Computer Science.

Thank you so much Sir. You are a motivation for millions!

He is a one man army, delivering the kind of knowledge and training no classes will ever be able to provide. The videos not only cover the breadth of the syllabus but also the depth, so it is a complete package. He has been the catalyst during my preparation whenever i felt I'm slowing down i used to watch his video 'How to get AIR 1 in GATE' and get paced up. He is the best mentor anyone could ever ask for and no words will ever be able to express how grateful I'm.

They suggested me to watch his demo videos. After watching sir’s GATE introduction videos, I came to a conclusion that it(GATE) is not tough anymore. In fact, it changed my complete thought process about GATE and they taught me the way of life. That day itself I joined GATExcel 135 and practiced each and every paper. Believe me, I almost explored all concepts of the subject in depth from each question and it made me fall in love with subjects. This is what made me crack GATE in final year itself.

The way sir designed and maintained that standard is Awesome.

                    I would like to start with a big THANKS!!!! Although we were not connected physically but I always felt sir’s presence while watching the videos. I decided to prepare for GATE examination after the end of my 2nd year (B.Tech). I saw his general videos on YouTube and that inspired me to go for higher studies. I saw his demo videos of Algorithms and Computer Networks and I was satisfied with the way of teaching. Few of my college seniors too had taken up your courses so they ensured me about the quality of his teaching.

                    I started completing all the subjects one by one and after completing a subject I practiced all the previous year GATE questions related to that subject. Once I covered the entire syllabus (85-90 percent) I started revising the subjects and towards the last months I appeared for test series that helped me to figure out my preparation.

                    During my preparation phase I used to watch all your general videos and they always boosted my confidence. I always tried to follow the strategies that you used to tell us. You were always a part of my preparation Sir. Although all the subjects were taught superbly but here are the list of subjects that I liked most:-

                    <li>Computer Networks(My favourite)</li>
                    <li>Operating Systems(Easiest of all)</li>
                    <li>Algorithms(Entire syllabus was covered perfectly)</li>
                    <li>Digital Logic(You made it look so easy, I was able to solve any type of question)</li>
                    <li>TOC(The way you explained every example made it easier for me)</li>


                    I would like to mention the following reasons for enrolling up for your courses:

                    <li> I was able to watch your videos anytime as per my convinience.</li>
                    <li>I was able to choose the ordering of subjects for preparation that helped me during my semester examinations too.</li>
                    <li>I was able to watch all the topics as many times I wished.</li>
                    <li>The course fee was reasonable as compared to other institutes.</li>

As I was already a fan of Ravindrababu Ravula sir by watching his YouTube videos, I decided to go for his GATE 2017 full course.

This course helped me polish my knowledge from GATE point of view in some campus subjects like DSA, DBMS, etc. While it helped build up even the basics for other subjects which I hadn't even touched like CO, CD, etc. Especially the CN course I felt was unparalleled as sir has worked in Cisco and refers to latest RFC developments.

Apart from the excellent technical course content, I also liked the way he took up aptitude, one thing I like about sir is that he never tell us to mug up something and explains the concepts from the basic level.

Moreover, his exam tips and motivational videos were the icing on the cake, they made me believe that I can achieve my dreams, not just in GATE, but in life, and while watching the videos I felt that he genuinely cared about his students. I felt like I had found a lifelong guru and friend in sir.">

His lectures are self sufficient for gate. He has taught each and every topic in such an easy manner that anyone can understand.

Apart from a great teacher, he is also a great motivator and mentor. The story that he shared about his friend who was preparing for IAS inspired me a lot. He even shared a pic of his friend.

His lessons about life filled me with positivity which I needed a lot because I was being told that I won't be able to crack gate as I had civil background.

He even suggested some books like 'The magic of thinking big', 'Good to great' which really motivated me. Thanks a lot sir without you it would have not been possible.

I started searching what to do and while searching landed upon Ravindrababu Ravula’s video lecture. That video inspired me a lot and that was one of the factors for me to do GATE.

This is my second attempt. I got 1025 rank in 2016(first attempt).But I was not satisfied. I wanted to get into top IITs. So I decided to drop an year and take up the exam next year. I had watched Ravi sir’s free video lectures before. I felt they were good, so I registered for his GATE course this time and finally got a rank of 119.

Now when I look back I can tell you that it was the best decision that I made. I can proudly tell everyone that nobody has covered all the topics to the extent to which Ravindrababu sir has done. The explanations are also very good and I am proud to call myself a student of Ravindrababu sir. Thank you.">

The best things about his teaching is the way he teaches the subject in such a beautiful manner that even after finishing long subjects like (CN , DBMS) you will feel that it’s just started and you will be eager to learn more !!

If you are in CS department and you are reading this in 1st year or 2nd year , then according to me blindly register for this GATE course ( It doesn't matter whether you want to appear for GATE or not ) , you will not regret your decision. The best thing of this course is you will get very good understanding of basic core subjects of computer science only in 8-9 months of preparation which many students even don't know after completing their B.Tech.

AND
For GATE CS his videos sufficient, you don't need to go to any classes. Just follow his instructions and believe me you will get AIR 1 , I registered for his GATE course in 6th semester and after preparing for 9 months I got AIR 132. I didn't get AIR 1 because I didn't follow him completely but believe me He is the man which will get you to AIR 1. The test series by RAVULA is also awesome and very much relevant to GATE syllabus and for any doubts during preparation just email him and you will definitely get response. His e-classes services are just awesome.

Nothing wrong in following someone who can make your journey easy and confident to reach your destination. And Gate is just an exam, don't make it a big deal.

I just enjoyed watching your lectures, at times I could spend the whole day learning from your lectures. You have done a tremendous job in preparing those lectures with utmost care.

Finally I decided to prepare for GATE just to know my subjects well and attempted GATE with 99% certainty of not leaving the Job. During my preparation I got the chance to attend TOC class in person by Ravula sir and became a fan of him and eventually registered to his videos. These remarkable lectures enlightened me about what actually computer science is and now I feel like reading more of computer science related stuffs than ever before.  Though I won't be going for full time higher studies ( already married and blessed with a beautiful daughter :) ), but GATE preparation through Ravula's videos has changed my life, boosted my confidence to another level and completely changed my way of looking at things and attacking problems at my work front. I wish if Ravula would have born few years earlier and I had such quality videos in my college time. Anyways there is no age for learning and now I am applying for part-time MS from IITD.  I would recommend every engineer to prepare for GATE during their college time itself as this is one of the way we get to understand our subjects well by solving previous years GATE questions which are truly conceptual and helps in solidifying the concepts learnt theoretically.

Then I saw some of Ravindrababu Ravula’s videos and realized, yes it can be done. The most challenging part was Automata and Compiler Design, they used to make me feel like an alien. But I have gone through his videos and that’s all, I came to know these subjects. Ravula is a fabulous teacher and I feel I’m very lucky to receive his guidance that has now put me in a position to accelerate in life and redefine it. A super thanks Mr. Ravula.

Well at start, I was little confused about which test series I should opt for. As there are many institutes that have this facility. I watched some guest lectures of Ravindrababu Ravula on You Tube. And they were quite amazing. So I gave it some thought and opted for GATExcel 135, a test series provided by Ravindra Babu Ravula institute. The test series was excellent. It had questions which cover almost every concept with various levels of difficulty. The solutions that were provided were accurate and still if I had any problem, I mailed them and my problem was resolved by some IITian or IIScian graduate within 24hrs. Either they would personally call me or mail me. So my overall experience was amazing. And when I gave GATE, it wasn't that hard for me. As most of the questions were repeated or had same concept. There was quite an improvement in my speed to solve the question.

But Ravi Sir encouraged me to give my best in first attempt only. His lecture videos are, no doubt,  'the best'. The simplicity with which he explained the topics made them interesting and easy to grasp on. I didn’t have time to attempt all the tests in test series and on his suggestion I took few Mock GATEs which really helped me to know what topics I had to brush up at last. But apart from that, the support you get from Ravi Sir's team with your doubts during preparation or to boost your morale when you feel demotivated is commendable. I wouldn't have done even this much if I didn't have had their support.


            He is not only an amazing teacher but an outstanding motivator too. Whenever I used to feel demotivated, I watch his video where he shared his story and how he overcame the difficulties and became inspiration for many. That video made me believe that nothing is impossible and that’s what I needed to believe in. He led the right path for me in the most crucial days of my preparation by telling me what to do and what not to and I am glad to have followed his advice.

Ravindra sir has wonderful knowledge. His GATE videos are very crisp and to the point. And if you study them dedicatedly, you will surely be landing in a very good college or PSU.

I saw various notes of coaching materials (hand written) and found so much abundance of unnecessary data which will never be asked in gate. But in these video data are to the point.

These are few advantages that I felt after joining his course:
 1. Being online classes, you can view them anywhere at any time (Especially in college).
 2. Videos can be viewed unlimited number of times.
 3.E-mail assistance for clarification of doubts.
 4. The problem collection is another huge plus point. Especially in automata, Computer Networks, DBMS, COA are extremely helpful, almost all kinds of problems are extensively solved and discussed.
 5. Test-series for testing your concepts and preparation for the exam.
 6. Cost of the course is very less compared to other coaching centers.

So, even though I did my B.E in Electronics & Communication, it inspired me to give GATE in Computer Science and follow my interest & dream to do Master’s in IISc/IIT. He teaches every single subject from scratch so that even B.E EC student can easily understand. His way of teaching is really good & you will never feel disinterested. He first explains concepts and after that he solves lot of examples on that topic, So I never had any doubts on any topic. Only thing I can say is the amount of knowledge I gained from watching his videos is far more than the knowledge i gained from my school to college days combined. I secured AIR 660 but I feel I could have done better. I could not give my 100% in those 3 hrs and made some silly mistakes in easiest questions.

But after watching your free demo lectures on you tube, the way you approach the concept and your motivation I could not stop myself by enrolling at your coaching. And now after 1 year its AIR 13, that is also in the final year itself. Sir you are the only teacher of whom I watched all lectures (not skipped a single one) and some of them twice . My day used to start with your lecture and end with your smile (sometime you taught me in my dreams also). Now I will be the student of best department of best college in the India, and that is possible only because of you. Thanks a lot for changing my life. You are really a Gabbar sir, I will always be a biggest fan of you.">

Truly speaking, when I joined classes for GATE, I planned to get good rank so that I may get some IIT, but your motivation changed my life which inspired me to do more than getting a good rank and getting admitted in IITs. As a result I got 21st rank in GATE and joined IISc. Whenever I think of you, I am always encouraged to do something new, innovative a nd good for human beings rather than only thinking about grades and money. I found you more as a brother than just a teacher because you have not taught me only subjects rather you taught me way of life and always helped me in my all decisions. I would like to be associated with you in all phases of my life, and would like to work with you... I have a lot to say, but can't express everything in words.">

His lectures on what to do on 2 months before the exam, 40 days before the exam ,30 days before the exam and how to attempt the exam were useful.

His video about Taking The Breaks is very important to every aspirant considering if I had followed it I might have not faced back pain issue I have faced. He has always been health conscious and used to take care of health of his student.I remember when he used to teach for us in classroom coaching if he felt that even single student is tired / sleepy he used used to ask all students to stand up and made us do quick workout.  His lectures are really good quality and he has made preparation easy for first time preparing students. His lectures on difficult subjects like Operating systems, Computer Networks etc. makes that subject really easy. You are doing a Great job and keep doing.">

I am very much thankful to the person who is the more respectable after my parents. He is Ravindrababu Ravula, the only person who had changed my negative energy to positive energy . Now I m studying in IIT which is possible only because of his inspiration and teaching. At the time of my B.tech final year I was thinking like entering an IIT is an impossible task to me . In my first attempt I was disqualified in the GATE examination. After this incident my confidence got reduced to zero for cracking GATE. At that situation my life is full of depression and unhappy. Failure is my close friend and success is my enemy. At that phase Ravindra sir motivated a lot. With that inspiration next year I got AIR 203. Now I am studying M.Tech in IITKGP. I didn't see such a person who have passion in teaching. Not only teaching I learned so much from his teachings. Not only studies, but also about life. IMPOSSIBLE is POSIBLE if ravindra sir is there. The days when I spent with him are the most memorable days in my life. I feel he is my own brother he shows that much affection towards me. Finally I owe you a lot in my entire life.

Today is very special day to me and I would like to thank the person for helping me in each and every step in my life. I am a girl who lived in a small village having no exposure to the outside world. Facing financial difficulties and health problems, I managed to get 74000 rank in EAMCET [Engineering entrance test within Andhra Pradesh] and got admission in a startup college. I never heard of IITs and NITs till my BTech 3 day, a person came to our college. He has done his Mtech in IISc Bangalore. He explained us how the life will be at IITs. His words built confidence in us, motivates us to achieve anything in life and removed the word “Impossible” from our thinking. He said, he is starting a GATE coaching institute and the very next day, I went to join his institute. I felt that everytime you speak with him, he fills his words with a lot of love. Those days were the memorable days in my life. He created such an environment, even when we don’t have classes we love to be there and enjoy. I enjoyed a lot and those were the very precious moments for me. I learned so much from his teachings, not only studies, but also about life. He says life is not but being happy and making others happy. His helping nature is incredible. For many students including me, even if they are ready to pay, he never accepted money from any of them. He says, “Things are to be used, People are to be loved”. He always says to have overconfidence, passion and be greedy to achieve success in life. After joining Mtech, I didn’t meet him, but his words always motivated me and helped me to take the right decision in my life. Today I got placed in ORACLE, my parents are very happy and proud of me. I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for helping me discover myself. Without him, I could not have been what I am now. Thank you Ravindrababu Ravula, for being instrumental in shaping my career and moulding me in to the person I am today">

I met with many good teachers in my life but you are the one to whom I can call the great teacher(THE MASTER). Many people in this world you find advising others to do some good but they don’t tell how to do it, when do it and if any obstacle come in the way how to overcome but Sir you gave me each answer and cleared all doubts which stop a person to star his/her pursuit. I feel honored that I met you, got a chance to learn things from you. Its been complete one year and still I feel the line you said on the first day we met “If there is nothing worth you can die for, there is nothing worth you can live for”. You teach everything about life aim, education, ethics, love . I never saw a person with so much energy. I heard about the Dalai Lama that when He goes through somewhere a kind of positive energy flows in that place, I don’t feel less than that about you. You are always ready to help people. You are a good friend and a great Master. I can write a book on you that kind of person you are and surely I am gonna do this. Last but not the least all can say is that” you are a game changer “. Guys I can bet with you on the first day you will become fan. The way of teaching and listening to the problems of everyone and taking steps to change society and always motivating people to do so makes you an extraordinary man. I hearty feel that I am so lucky that I got a Master like you in my life. Thanx for being a true friend and master,,,J:- Pradeep Pannu, Thapar University.

I got failed in second semister of engineering. My result was full low. One fine day, I saw MY GURU RAVI sir on youtube. Then my life started. He is god of computer science, the way he teaches, even a small guy can understand it. Even after having less result, I got into a dream company just because of Ravi sir. I took online coaching from sir. I got placed in 2 companies Tecnotree(core) and Oracle(dream). Now i am working in oracle as a application developer just because of him. I started following what ever he used to tell me. I took a scan copy of his photo and pasted in my room, daily i used to see him and get inspired. Now he became a part of my life. Still i didn't get a chance to meet him. I dedicate my success to him. He is my god.

His class will never be boring because he just not goofs up wid theory, rather teaches u in an practical manner. We always feel that he is one among us who is teaching .We eagerly wait for his next class,such an enthusiastic person he is. He is very illuminative and spends his most of the time with students. Desire, Believe and Enjoy is his mantra. Rather than a Lecturer, we find him as our IDOL and follow him. If you have any problem, he is always there for u. Apart from all these, He is very handsome :D He is complete amass of a perfect person :) Thats why, we all love and respect him.ThankYou sir for everything. Whatever I am till now, I owe to u.

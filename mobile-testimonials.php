I watched his free videos of all subjects on YouTube. These videos are enough for creating interest in the subjects. Moreover I also joined Ravindra Sir's test series, which contains many good questions with solution especially for computer networks and theory of computation. I learnt many concepts from test series alone. I would like to suggest any future aspirant to join Ravindra Sir's coaching and I am sure he will make you perform your best.">

The day that changed my destiny. After watching the first video itself, I was certain I wanted to watch every gate tutorial Ravi sir has ever made. He is a one man army, delivering the kind of knowledge and training no classes will ever be able to provide. The videos not only cover the breadth of the syllabus but also the depth, so it is a complete package. He has been the catalyst during my preparation whenever i felt I'm slowing down i used to watch his video 'How to get AIR 1 in GATE' and get paced up. He is the best mentor anyone could ever ask for and no words will ever be able to express how grateful I'm.

            Thank you sir!

Then I came across Ravi Sir's lectures in YouTube and after watching the first couple of lectures I got to know that this is what I want to study and from whom I want to study from. The confidence that Ravi sir instills in people with even the lowest self esteem is what makes him a great guru.

He lays a path for people who like to work hard and achieve things in life with his awesome lectures and motivational videos. To achieve something great you need hardwork and right path. Hard work is something that depends on your motivation but Ravi sir lectures will provide you a right path.">

They suggested me to watch his demo videos. After watching sir’s GATE introduction videos, I came to a conclusion that it(GATE) is not tough anymore. In fact, it changed my complete thought process about GATE and they taught me the way of life. That day itself I joined GATExcel 135 and practiced each and every paper. Believe me, I almost explored all concepts of the subject in depth from each question and it made me fall in love with subjects. This is what made me crack GATE in final year itself.

The way sir designed and maintained that standard is Awesome.

Thanks a lot sir, for making my dream come true.">

                    I would like to start with a big THANKS!!!! Although we were not connected physically but I always felt sir’s presence while watching the videos. I decided to prepare for GATE examination after the end of my 2nd year (B.Tech). I saw his general videos on YouTube and that inspired me to go for higher studies. I saw his demo videos of Algorithms and Computer Networks and I was satisfied with the way of teaching. Few of my college seniors too had taken up your courses so they ensured me about the quality of his teaching.

                    I started completing all the subjects one by one and after completing a subject I practiced all the previous year GATE questions related to that subject. Once I covered the entire syllabus (85-90 percent) I started revising the subjects and towards the last months I appeared for test series that helped me to figure out my preparation.

                    During my preparation phase I used to watch all your general videos and they always boosted my confidence. I always tried to follow the strategies that you used to tell us. You were always a part of my preparation Sir. Although all the subjects were taught superbly but here are the list of subjects that I liked most:-

                    <li>Computer Networks(My favourite)</li>
                    <li>Operating Systems(Easiest of all)</li>
                    <li>Algorithms(Entire syllabus was covered perfectly)</li>
                    <li>Digital Logic(You made it look so easy, I was able to solve any type of question)</li>
                    <li>TOC(The way you explained every example made it easier for me)</li>


                    I would like to mention the following reasons for enrolling up for your courses:

                    <li> I was able to watch your videos anytime as per my convinience.</li>
                    <li>I was able to choose the ordering of subjects for preparation that helped me during my semester examinations too.</li>
                    <li>I was able to watch all the topics as many times I wished.</li>
                    <li>The course fee was reasonable as compared to other institutes.</li>


                    I always waited for the day to meet you and finally I am getting the opportunity

As I was already a fan of Ravindrababu Ravula sir by watching his YouTube videos, I decided to go for his GATE 2017 full course.

This course helped me polish my knowledge from GATE point of view in some campus subjects like DSA, DBMS, etc. While it helped build up even the basics for other subjects which I hadn't even touched like CO, CD, etc. Especially the CN course I felt was unparalleled as sir has worked in Cisco and refers to latest RFC developments.

Apart from the excellent technical course content, I also liked the way he took up aptitude, one thing I like about sir is that he never tell us to mug up something and explains the concepts from the basic level.

Moreover, his exam tips and motivational videos were the icing on the cake, they made me believe that I can achieve my dreams, not just in GATE, but in life, and while watching the videos I felt that he genuinely cared about his students. I felt like I had found a lifelong guru and friend in sir.">

His subject lectures cover each every minute concept that could be asked in the exam. His test series are unique and cover every exceptional detail possible in the exam.

His motivational videos that were released periodically few days before exams helped me a lot because they are exactly what a student wants at that point of time.

His lectures are self sufficient for gate. He has taught each and every topic in such an easy manner that anyone can understand.

Apart from a great teacher, he is also a great motivator and mentor. The story that he shared about his friend who was preparing for IAS inspired me a lot. He even shared a pic of his friend.

His lessons about life filled me with positivity which I needed a lot because I was being told that I won't be able to crack gate as I had civil background.

He even suggested some books like 'The magic of thinking big', 'Good to great' which really motivated me. Thanks a lot sir without you it would have not been possible.

I started searching what to do and while searching landed upon Ravindrababu Ravula’s video lecture. That video inspired me a lot and that was one of the factors for me to do GATE.

This is my second attempt. I got 1025 rank in 2016(first attempt).But I was not satisfied. I wanted to get into top IITs. So I decided to drop an year and take up the exam next year. I had watched Ravi sir’s free video lectures before. I felt they were good, so I registered for his GATE course this time and finally got a rank of 119.

Now when I look back I can tell you that it was the best decision that I made. I can proudly tell everyone that nobody has covered all the topics to the extent to which Ravindrababu sir has done. The explanations are also very good and I am proud to call myself a student of Ravindrababu sir. Thank you.">

The best things about his teaching is the way he teaches the subject in such a beautiful manner that even after finishing long subjects like (CN , DBMS) you will feel that it’s just started and you will be eager to learn more !!

If you are in CS department and you are reading this in 1st year or 2nd year , then according to me blindly register for this GATE course ( It doesn't matter whether you want to appear for GATE or not ) , you will not regret your decision. The best thing of this course is you will get very good understanding of basic core subjects of computer science only in 8-9 months of preparation which many students even don't know after completing their B.Tech.

AND
For GATE CS his videos sufficient, you don't need to go to any classes. Just follow his instructions and believe me you will get AIR 1 , I registered for his GATE course in 6th semester and after preparing for 9 months I got AIR 132. I didn't get AIR 1 because I didn't follow him completely but believe me He is the man which will get you to AIR 1. The test series by RAVULA is also awesome and very much relevant to GATE syllabus and for any doubts during preparation just email him and you will definitely get response. His e-classes services are just awesome.

Nothing wrong in following someone who can make your journey easy and confident to reach your destination. And Gate is just an exam, don't make it a big deal.

I must say truly, this course is self-sufficient for gate aspirants. You have covered CN at extra depth. I wish I could keep them with me for my future reference. I just enjoyed watching your lectures, at times I could spend the whole day learning from your lectures. You have done a tremendous job in preparing those lectures with utmost care.

Apart from Gate Lectures, your motivational talks also helped me a lot. As far as I have seen you in the lectures, you are a very nice, humble, down to earth person, with extraordinary determination (I am saying this because in one of the videos I got to know about your childhood struggles, true example of hard work always pay off).

The topics in a video are well oriented towards connecting concepts and hence help having a total idea. He knows the contents of the syllabus very well and always stick to it. But also you make it a point to always give something extra. And above all, the amount of motivation you flush through all the student minds is amazing and is much needed. India certainly needs lot more of your kind.

The topics tests for some subjects are really good (like TOC, Engineering mathematics, Database, Digital Design), and they did certainly help me in clearing my doubts and concepts. The test series were useful in knowing various types of questions and managing time.

The videos are really good for self paced learning and they make us feel that GATE is easily CRACKABLE (they did say the truth!).I would recommend it to anyone anytime. The videos are concise and to the point.

Apart from a superb hold over the various topics across the spectrum of Computer science, he possesses excellent public speaking skills and is a true motivation mill. His classes are exuberant, and have a more session like flavour, giving students ample time to think on their own, something I feel is extremely conducive in developing a good understanding of the subject matter. (I don't remember anyone dozing off even during longest of his lectures). I know many students who started believing in themselves after attending his classes and went on to achieve goals they never thought were within their grasp. Interacting with him has always been a pleasure and I hope I will benefit from his association for days to come.">

He has always been health conscious and used to take care of health of his student.I remember when he used to teach for us in classroom coaching if he felt that even single student is tired / sleepy he used used to ask all students to stand up and made us do quick workout.

Now I m studying in IIT which is possible only because of his inspiration and teaching. At the time of my B.tech final year I was thinking like entering an IIT is an impossible task to me . In my first attempt I was disqualified in the GATE examination. After this incident my confidence got reduced to zero for cracking GATE. At that situation my life is full of depression and unhappy. Failure is my close friend and success is my enemy. At that phase Ravindra sir motivated a lot. With that inspiration next year I got AIR 203. Now I am studying M.Tech in IITKGP. I didn't see such a person who have passion in teaching. Not only teaching I learned so much from his teachings. Not only studies, but also about life. IMPOSSIBLE is POSIBLE if ravindra sir is there. The days when I spent with him are the most memorable days in my life. I feel he is my own brother he shows that much affection towards me. Finally I owe you a lot in my entire life.

Today is very special day to me and I would like to thank the person for helping me in each and every step in my life. I am a girl who lived in a small village having no exposure to the outside world. Facing financial difficulties and health problems, I managed to get 74000 rank in EAMCET [Engineering entrance test within Andhra Pradesh] and got admission in a startup college. I never heard of IITs and NITs till my BTech 3 day, a person came to our college. He has done his Mtech in IISc Bangalore. He explained us how the life will be at IITs. His words built confidence in us, motivates us to achieve anything in life and removed the word “Impossible” from our thinking. He said, he is starting a GATE coaching institute and the very next day, I went to join his institute. I felt that everytime you speak with him, he fills his words with a lot of love. Those days were the memorable days in my life. He created such an environment, even when we don’t have classes we love to be there and enjoy. I enjoyed a lot and those were the very precious moments for me. I learned so much from his teachings, not only studies, but also about life. He says life is not but being happy and making others happy. His helping nature is incredible. For many students including me, even if they are ready to pay, he never accepted money from any of them. He says, “Things are to be used, People are to be loved”. He always says to have overconfidence, passion and be greedy to achieve success in life. After joining Mtech, I didn’t meet him, but his words always motivated me and helped me to take the right decision in my life. Today I got placed in ORACLE, my parents are very happy and proud of me. I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for helping me discover myself. Without him, I could not have been what I am now. Thank you Ravindrababu Ravula, for being instrumental in shaping my career and moulding me in to the person I am today">

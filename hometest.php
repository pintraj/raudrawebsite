I started taking his online classes in Febraury 2015 and I topped in DBMS and Computer networks in the college just because of those classes. And I have got placed in ‘Deloitte’ , the first company to have come in the campus , again because of him. Now I am looking forward to score a very good rank in GATE. So I would say my career took a significant direction since I started with his classes. I owe him everything whatever I will achieve in future.">

If after some teaching he finds that energy of class is down then he will change the topic or crack some jokes to get everyone's attention back. This is very useful and result driven for an average student like me. And to achieve success of any kind, motivation and positive energy matters a lot then knowledge.">

After Watching your videos, I know how to learn, I know to look exactly for the main point and cut out all the crap. Able to learn any tool or language or technology using the basics from Algo,Networks,OS,DBMS. Able to code optimally by designing my own Algorithm for any given problem. Connect to any remote servers & clients and use any protocol from command line across subnets. I can easily write multithreaded programs and can easily synchronize them. I can explain Normalization even if some one wakes me up in middle of my sleep. I can actually visualize recursion . (I think it would have taken 3 to 4 years for me to understand this). GPA in Sem 3 -- 3.85/4 ----  Sem 4 -- 4/4. I have confidence in me that i can clear interview rounds more easily.I have dedicated just 3 months of my time to just watch your videos and i was able to clearly see the difference in my confidence. I was able to answer a lot of questions from basics and i was able to guess what they will be asking next.I don't know about GATE but the precision with which you explain each concept is brilliant. Thanks a​ ​lot for helping me and i am pretty confident that these qualities taught by you will give me an edge over other people in my professional life. I have got an offer as Associate software developer from Pearson Education and i am joining my job from ">

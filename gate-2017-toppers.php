            <p>I really appreciate sir’s effort. His motivational videos helped me to stay positive throughout my preparation. He is one of the finest teachers I have ever seen.</p>
                <p>I feel very much lucky that I got a chance to learn from him. You are doing a fabulous job sir. Keep going.

                <p>Sir, you are just simply awesome and the way you had taught all subjects is more interesting. After watching videos of each subject, I hardly found any doubt and the concepts are really taught in a simple and elegant way. Along with your course videos, your motivational videos, I must say that they are a must watch for everyone and they had a great impact on me also. I used to watch them whenever I feel demotivated and off track.
                Thank you!

                <p> A few months ago while searching for Gate I stumbled upon Ravindra Sir’s demo lectures on YouTube. I watched a couple of his Networking lectures and was awed by the way he had made everything seem so simple and interesting. At that very moment I decided to opt for his full course. His knowledge, dedication and hard work reflect in his videos as they are really good in content. They help you prepare not only for GATE but also in general, develop an interest in the field of Computer Science. </p>

                    <p>Thank you so much Sir. You are a motivation for millions!</p>

                <p>Ravindra Sir is an extra ordinary teacher with gifted talents and an amazing public speaker. I decided to prepare for GATE by watching his inspirational videos. I watched his free videos of all subjects on YouTube. These videos are enough for creating interest in the subjects. Moreover I also joined Ravindra Sir's test series, which contains many good questions with solution especially for computer networks and theory of computation. I learnt many concepts from test series alone. I would like to suggest any future aspirant to join Ravindra Sir's coaching and I am sure he will make you perform your best.

After watching the first video itself, I was certain I wanted to watch every gate tutorial Ravi sir has ever made. He is a one man army, delivering the kind of knowledge and training no classes will ever be able to provide. The videos not only cover the breadth of the syllabus but also the depth, so it is a complete package.  He has been the catalyst during my preparation whenever i felt I'm slowing down i used to watch his video "How to get AIR 1 in GATE" and get paced up. He is the best mentor anyone could ever ask for and no words will ever be able to express how grateful I'm.</p>

Initially, I thought GATE was the toughest exam and it is possible to crack it only with 2 or 3 years of continuous coaching. During that time, I got to know about Ravindra sir from my seniors. They suggested me to watch his demo videos. After watching sir’s GATE introduction videos, I came to a conclusion that it(GATE) is not tough anymore. In fact, it changed my complete thought process about GATE and they taught me the way of life. That day itself I joined GATExcel 135 and practiced each and every paper. Believe me, I almost explored all concepts of the subject in depth from each question and it made me fall in love with subjects. This is what made me crack GATE in final year itself.</p>

I like the way he teaches, starting from the very scratch and taking the topic to the utmost level without lacking any concept at any level. He is a role model. Moreover, the only thing that matters is how badly one wants something and is there someone by his side to guide him who has already travelled through the same path. And, that guidance was well provided by Ravi Sir. May God bless every student with a teacher like him from the very beginning of his/her life.

Ravi sir is the first person to create confidence in me from his YouTube videos that gate CS is not difficult and can be cracked with little effort. I enrolled for his classes and thoroughly enjoyed them. I loved CN, TOC and DBMS personally. Sir kept in adding motivational videos to boost confidence. Also I like sir's confidence. I see these days sir is also teaching other than gate stuff. I hope people get benefited from that also. I'm excited to share this happiness with him.

                    I would like to start with a big THANKS!!!! Although we were not connected physically but I always felt sir’s presence while watching the videos. I decided to prepare for GATE examination after the end of my 2nd year (B.Tech). I saw his general videos on YouTube and that inspired me to go for higher studies. I saw his demo videos of Algorithms and Computer Networks and I was satisfied with the way of teaching. Few of my college seniors too had taken up your courses so they ensured me about the quality of his teaching.

                    I started completing all the subjects one by one and after completing a subject I practiced all the previous year GATE questions related to that subject. Once I covered the entire syllabus (85-90 percent) I started revising the subjects and towards the last months I appeared for test series that helped me to figure out my preparation.

                    During my preparation phase I used to watch all your general videos and they always boosted my confidence. I always tried to follow the strategies that you used to tell us. You were always a part of my preparation Sir. Although all the subjects were taught superbly but here are the list of subjects that I liked most:-

                    <li>Computer Networks(My favourite)</li>
                    <li>Operating Systems(Easiest of all)</li>
                    <li>Algorithms(Entire syllabus was covered perfectly)</li>
                    <li>Digital Logic(You made it look so easy, I was able to solve any type of question)</li>
                    <li>TOC(The way you explained every example made it easier for me)</li>


                    I would like to mention the following reasons for enrolling up for your courses:

                    <li> I was able to watch your videos anytime as per my convinience.</li>
                    <li>I was able to choose the ordering of subjects for preparation that helped me during my semester examinations too.</li>
                    <li>I was able to watch all the topics as many times I wished.</li>
                    <li>The course fee was reasonable as compared to other institutes.</li>


                    I always waited for the day to meet you and finally I am getting the opportunity

                <p> I owe Ravindrababu Ravula sir for my success in GATE 2017. Actually I never really studied very seriously for GATE till my 7th semester, just that I prepared all the concepts from University exam and campus point of view.</p>

                <p>As I was already a fan of Ravindrababu Ravula sir by watching his YouTube videos, I decided to go for his GATE 2017 full course.</p>

                <p>This course helped me polish my knowledge from GATE point of view in some campus subjects like DSA, DBMS, etc. While it helped build up even the basics for other subjects which I hadn't even touched like CO, CD, etc. Especially the CN course I felt was unparalleled as sir has worked in Cisco and refers to latest RFC developments.</p>

                <p>Apart from the excellent technical course content, I also liked the way he took up aptitude, one thing I like about sir is that he never tell us to mug up something and explains the concepts from the basic level.</p>

                <p></p>Moreover, his exam tips and motivational videos were the icing on the cake, they made me believe that I can achieve my dreams, not just in GATE, but in life, and while watching the videos I felt that he genuinely cared about his students. I felt like I had found a lifelong guru and friend in sir.

                <p>   Ravindra Sir is one of the best teachers I have ever studied from. It's not what he teaches makes him so favorite ... It’s the way he teaches. Studying from him makes everything just so simple...easy…logical and interesting....  I feel so lucky to have joined his online classes.  Since I started studying along with job...ease of watching anytime and anywhere helped me a lot as I could manage studying daily along with office... Without his help I don’t think it would have been possible to secure a good rank..

                    I came to know about Ravi Sir's lectures from a friend of mine who was preparing for GATE and this is how my journey towards cracking the exam started. He teaches with great passion from the very basic concepts of the subjects that even a B.Tech Electrical student like me can now say that I know CS much better than I ever knew Electrical.</p>
                    <p>His subject lectures cover each every minute concept that could be asked in the exam. His test series are unique and cover every exceptional detail possible in the exam.</p>
                <p>His motivational videos that were released periodically few days before exams helped me a lot because they are exactly what a student wants at that point of time.</p>
                <p>So I had a great learning experience throughout the preparation time.

I had been following his videos since June 2016. The way he explained things- what was the problem initially and its solution and the way a certain thing came into existence- made my life a lot easier. I can't stop thanking him, especially for Computer Networks. Never in my 4 years of engineering had I understood anything about networks. Thank You Sir!</p>

                    The story that he shared about his friend who was preparing for IAS inspired me a lot. He even shared a pic of his friend.</p>
                    <p>His lessons about life filled me with positivity which I needed a lot because I was being told that I won't be able to crack gate as I had civil background.</p>
                    <p>He even suggested some books like "The magic of thinking big", "Good to great" which really motivated me.
                    Thanks a lot sir without you it would have not been possible.

                <p>Hello, this is Nagesh
                    I got AIR 119. The journey of gate started when I was in my 5th semester. I started searching what to do and while searching landed upon Ravindrababu Ravula’s video lecture. That video inspired me a lot and that was one of the factors for me to do GATE.</p>
                <p>This is my second attempt. I got 1025 rank in 2016(first attempt).But I was not satisfied. I wanted to get into top IITs. So I decided to drop an year and take up the exam next year. I had watched Ravi sir’s free video lectures before. I felt they were good, so I registered for his GATE course this time and finally got a rank of 119.</p>
                    <p>Now when I look back I can tell you that it was the best decision that I made. I can proudly tell everyone that nobody has covered all the topics to the extent to which Ravindrababu sir has done. The explanations are also very good and I am proud to call myself a student of Ravindrababu sir. Thank you.

                <p>Eclasses of Ravindrababu Ravula is one of the best source if you are a computer science student or also if you are not & if you are interested in real learning ( not exam and pointers oriented ). The best things about his teaching is the way he teaches the subject in such a beautiful manner that even after finishing long subjects like (CN , DBMS) you will feel that it’s just started and  you will be eager to learn more !!</p>
                <p>If you are in CS department and you are reading this in 1st year or 2nd  year , then according to me blindly register for this GATE course ( It doesn't matter whether you want to appear for GATE or not ) , you will not regret your decision. The best thing of this course is you will get very good understanding of basic core subjects of computer science only in 8-9 months of preparation which many students even don't know after completing their B.Tech.</p>
                    AND
                <p>For GATE CS his videos sufficient, you don't need to go to any classes. Just follow his instructions and believe me you will get AIR 1 , I registered for his GATE course in 6th semester and after preparing for 9 months I got AIR 132. I didn't get AIR 1 because I didn't follow him completely but believe me He is the man which will get you to AIR 1. The test series by RAVULA is also awesome and very much relevant to GATE syllabus and for any doubts during preparation just email him and you will definitely get response. His e-classes services are just awesome.</p>

                    <p>Nothing wrong in following someone who can make your journey easy and confident to reach your destination. And Gate is just an exam, don't make it a big deal.</p>

I mean at several occasions in the duration of full course you could have skipped some concepts, but you chose to repeat the same concept again and again while solving every related question so that every student can understand the core concepts. I must say truly, this course is self-sufficient for gate aspirants. You have covered CN at extra depth. I wish I could keep them with me for my future reference. I just enjoyed watching your lectures, at times I could spend the whole day learning from your lectures. You have done a tremendous job in preparing those lectures with utmost care.</p>
                <p>Apart from Gate Lectures, your motivational talks also helped me a lot. As far as I have seen you in the lectures, you are a very nice, humble, down to earth person, with extraordinary determination (I am saying this because in one of the videos I got to know about your childhood struggles, true example of hard work always pay off).</p>

You (your lectures) gave me confidence to try to solve or at least understand the numerical question which was out of my comfort zone for subjects like Computer Organization (CO).

The topics in a video are well oriented towards connecting concepts and hence help having a total idea. He knows the contents of the syllabus very well and always stick to it.

                <p>The e-classes of Ravindrababu Ravula helped me a lot...each and every subject and each and every topic have been covered taking care about all the minute details. The very exciting thing is that after covering each topic ravula sir takes up some previous year examples or some good questions which helps in understanding the concepts more clearly..moreover if I got stuck at any concept I mailed him the doubts and got reply within a couple of days..that’s great...his general tips about how to crack gate also motivated me a lot.</p>
                <p>Regarding test series- its filled with beautiful questions on some really good concepts...each and every test should be given with pure sincerity...it gives a good practice and trains you for the gate exam. Ravula sir is great..I wanted to get less than 100 rank but I made a couple of silly mistakes..but I would like to say anyone who watches all the videos with sincerity and takes all the tests...coming under 100 is not a difficult task.</p>
                    Thank you.

                    GATE 2017 AIR 245. All credit goes to you, Sir. Coming this far (thinking about IIT/IISc) would have never been possible without him.  His way of explaining the concept is more than superb. Once again thank you very much sir.</p>

                <p>I would like to share my experience with Ravula Sir here. I took Ravula Sir lectures around August when I was still at my first job in a service based company. After studying simultaneously with my Job for around 2 months I decided to give full time preparation for GATE. With just 4 months of preparation from October and following Ravula Sir lectures whole heartedly I was able to crack GATE in my first attempt. He is a great teacher and a perfect motivator. I would highly recommend Ravula Sir lectures to anyone who is serious about cracking GATE.

The best part of Ravindra sir's coaching is the Journey which has wonderful learning experience and of course a great success standing at the destination. Entire syllabus has been covered in the GATE course and I understood each and every subject with so much ease. I got my every doubt cleared within a day or two. I owe this success to wonderful teacher like you. Thank you for making a beautiful impact on my life.

I felt that you have this amazing quality which made even the difficult topics simpler to someone having no knowledge of Computer Science. Your lectures helped me by building my base of CS subjects stronger. Thank you Sir for your support and guidance. You are awesome!!

                <p>I've got AIR-312 and a score of 772, I would like to thank Ravi Sir for your lectures and everything. It really helped me a lot in my preparation. I have focused on the development of concepts and practicing as many questions as possible. The test series from Ravindra sir covers the basics which is the heart of GATE. It helps building up the knowledge from understanding the basics to implementing it to various questions and scenarios. After learning basics I have focused on giving tests assuming its GATE exam and giving the GATE exam considering it another test series. Apart from this stay focused and aim high and always take motivation from your loved ones.This really help to keep a positive attitude.

He makes things very easy and also taught about how to look at different approaches of the questions and how to tackle pressure of the examination. This may seem like exaggeration but</p>

Your way of teaching is amazing so that any ordinary student like me can understand concepts easily and clearly. Also the test series kept pushing my boundary each and every time. I am glad that I got a chance to learn from you. I will always be thankful to you for being an excellent teacher and a great motivational speaker.

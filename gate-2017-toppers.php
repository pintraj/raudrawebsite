                        After watching videos of each subject, I hardly found any doubt and the concepts are really
                        taught in a simple and elegant way. Along with your course videos, your motivational videos, I
                        must say that they are a must watch for everyone and they had a great impact on me also. I used
                        to watch them whenever I feel demotivated and off track.

                        A few months ago while searching for Gate I stumbled upon Ravindra Sir’s demo lectures on YouTube. I watched a couple of his Networking lectures and was awed by the way he had made everything seem so simple and interesting. At that very moment I decided to opt for his full course. His knowledge, dedication and hard work reflect in his videos as they are really good in content. They help you prepare not only for GATE but also in general, develop an interest in the field of Computer Science. </p>

Moreover I also joined Ravindra Sir's test series, which contains many good questions with solution especially for computer networks and theory of computation. I learnt many concepts from test series alone. I would like to suggest any future aspirant to join Ravindra Sir's coaching and I am sure he will make you perform your best.

                        package. He has been the catalyst during my preparation whenever i felt I'm slowing down i used
                        to watch his video "How to get AIR 1 in GATE" and get paced up. He is the best mentor anyone

                    <p>I am Sai Prasad Kousika, I secured All India Rank 37 in GATE-2017 in Computer Science. Initially,
                        I thought GATE was the toughest exam and it is possible to crack it only with 2 or 3 years of
                        continuous coaching. During that time, I got to know about Ravindra sir from my seniors. They
                        suggested me to watch his demo videos. After watching sir’s GATE introduction videos, I came to
                        a conclusion that it(GATE) is not tough anymore. In fact, it changed my complete thought process
                        about GATE and they taught me the way of life. That day itself I joined GATExcel 135 and
                        practiced each and every paper. Believe me, I almost explored all concepts of the subject in
                        depth from each question and it made me fall in love with subjects. This is what made me crack
                        GATE in final year itself.</p>
                    <p>The way sir designed and maintained that standard is Awesome.</p>

                        algorithms, computer vision and AI, I decided to do Masters in CS. Ravi sir is the first person
                        to create confidence in me from his YouTube videos that gate CS is not difficult and can be
                        cracked with little effort. I enrolled for his classes and thoroughly enjoyed them. I loved CN,
                        TOC and DBMS personally. Sir kept in adding motivational videos to boost confidence. Also I like
                        sir's confidence. I see these days sir is also teaching other than gate stuff. I hope people get
                        benefited from that also. I'm excited to share this happiness with him.

                    <p>I did my B.Tech from IIT Roorkee in Computer Science. I am currently working in Visa Inc. from last 1.5 years. I always wanted to go for higher studies. There were two options : some university in USA or IIT/IISc. Due to financial restraint, I decided to give a try to GATE. </p>
                    <p>I started preparing from Ravi Sir's e-clravinasses around Mid October. His e-classes are precise and well groomed for GATE preparation, especially for aspirants who want to secure under 100 rank. </p>
                        <p>Test series provided by Ravi sir is comprehensive and cover all topics to the required depth. Test series is a must if you dont want to lose those 5-10 marks in "THE" exam day which could cost you severely.

                    <p>
                        I would like to start with a big THANKS!!!! Although we were not connected physically but I
                        always felt sir’s presence while watching the videos. I decided to prepare for GATE examination
                        after the end of my 2nd year (B.Tech). I saw his general videos on YouTube and that inspired me
                        to go for higher studies. I saw his demo videos of Algorithms and Computer Networks and I was
                        satisfied with the way of teaching. Few of my college seniors too had taken up your courses so
                        they ensured me about the quality of his teaching.

                        I started completing all the subjects one by one and after completing a subject I practiced all
                        the previous year GATE questions related to that subject. Once I covered the entire syllabus
                        (85-90 percent) I started revising the subjects and towards the last months I appeared for test
                        series that helped me to figure out my preparation.

                        During my preparation phase I used to watch all your general videos and they always boosted my
                        confidence. I always tried to follow the strategies that you used to tell us. You were always a
                        part of my preparation Sir. Although all the subjects were taught superbly but here are the list
                        of subjects that I liked most:-

                    <li>Computer Networks(My favourite)</li>
                    <li>Operating Systems(Easiest of all)</li>
                    <li>Algorithms(Entire syllabus was covered perfectly)</li>
                    <li>Digital Logic(You made it look so easy, I was able to solve any type of question)</li>
                    <li>TOC(The way you explained every example made it easier for me)</li>


                    I would like to mention the following reasons for enrolling up for your courses:

                    <li> I was able to watch your videos anytime as per my convinience.</li>
                    <li>I was able to choose the ordering of subjects for preparation that helped me during my semester
                        examinations too.
                    </li>
                    <li>I was able to watch all the topics as many times I wished.</li>
                    <li>The course fee was reasonable as compared to other institutes.</li>

                    <p>   I owe Ravindrababu Ravula sir for my success in GATE 2017. Actually I never really studied very seriously for GATE till my 7th semester, just that I prepared all the concepts from University exam and campus point of view.</p>

                    <p>As I was already a fan of Ravindrababu Ravula sir by watching his YouTube videos, I decided to go for his GATE 2017 full course.</p>

                    <p>This course helped me polish my knowledge from GATE point of view in some campus subjects like DSA, DBMS, etc. While it helped build up even the basics for other subjects which I hadn't even touched like CO, CD, etc. Especially the CN course I felt was unparalleled as sir has worked in Cisco and refers to latest RFC developments.</p>

                    <p>Apart from the excellent technical course content, I also liked the way he took up aptitude, one thing I like about sir is that he never tell us to mug up something and explains the concepts from the basic level.</p>

                        <p>Moreover, his exam tips and motivational videos were the icing on the cake, they made me believe that I can achieve my dreams, not just in GATE, but in life, and while watching the videos I felt that he genuinely cared about his students. I felt like I had found a lifelong guru and friend in sir.

He teaches with great passion from the very basic concepts of the subjects that even a B.Tech Electrical student like me can now say that I know CS much better than I ever knew Electrical.
                        His subject lectures cover each every minute concept that could be asked in the exam. His test series are unique and cover every exceptional detail possible in the exam.</p>
                    <p>His motivational videos that were released periodically few days before exams helped me a lot because they are exactly what a student wants at that point of time.</p>
                        <p>So I had a great learning experience throughout the preparation time.

                        I did my B.Tech in Civil Engineering and had zero knowledge in CS but Ravindra Sir's lectures
                        made it very easy and interesting for me.</p>

                    <p>Apart from a great teacher, he is also a great motivator and mentor.
                        The story that he shared about his friend who was preparing for IAS inspired me a lot. He even
                        shared a pic of his friend.</p>
                    <p>His lessons about life filled me with positivity which I needed a lot because I was being told

                    <p>He even suggested some books like "The magic of thinking big", "Good to great" which really
                        motivated me.

                    <p>I got AIR 119. The journey of gate started when I was in my 5th semester. I started searching what to do and while searching landed upon Ravindrababu Ravula’s video lecture. That video inspired me a lot and that was one of the factors for me to do GATE.</p>
                    <p>This is my second attempt. I got 1025 rank in 2016(first attempt).But I was not satisfied. I wanted to get into top IITs. So I decided to drop an year and take up the exam next year. I had watched Ravi sir’s free video lectures before. I felt they were good, so I registered for his GATE course this time and finally got a rank of 119.</p>
                    <p>Now when I look back I can tell you that it was the best decision that I made. I can proudly tell everyone that nobody has covered all the topics to the extent to which Ravindrababu sir has done. The explanations are also very good and I am proud to call myself a student of Ravindrababu sir. Thank you.</p>

                        or not ) , you will not regret your decision. The best thing of this course is you will get very
                        good understanding of basic core subjects of computer science only in 8-9 months of preparation
                        which many students even don't know after completing their B.Tech. <br>
                    AND</p>
                    <p>For GATE CS his videos sufficient, you don't need to go to any classes. Just follow his
                        instructions and believe me you will get AIR 1 , I registered for his GATE course in 6th
                        semester and after preparing for 9 months I got AIR 132. I didn't get AIR 1 because I didn't
                        follow him completely but believe me He is the man which will get you to AIR 1. The test series
                        by RAVULA is also awesome and very much relevant to GATE syllabus and for any doubts during
                        preparation just email him and you will definitely get response. His e-classes services are just
                        awesome.</p>

                    <p>Nothing wrong in following someone who can make your journey easy and confident to reach your
                        destination. And Gate is just an exam, don't make it a big deal.</p>

                    <p>Ravi Sir’s tutorial videos are excellent in terms of depth of information/concept it contains, as well as the way you have prepared them. I mean at several occasions in the duration of full course you could have skipped some concepts, but you chose to repeat the same concept again and again while solving every related question so that every student can understand the core concepts. I must say truly, this course is self-sufficient for gate aspirants. You have covered CN at extra depth. I wish I could keep them with me for my future reference. I just enjoyed watching your lectures, at times I could spend the whole day learning from your lectures. You have done a tremendous job in preparing those lectures with utmost care.</p>
                    <p>Apart from Gate Lectures, your motivational talks also helped me a lot. As far as I have seen you in the lectures, you are a very nice, humble, down to earth person, with extraordinary determination (I am saying this because in one of the videos I got to know about your childhood struggles, true example of hard work always pay off).</p>

One last thing I would like to add is sir’s motivation is at par. It was only you who motivated me to go for GATE and kept me motivated throughout my preparations.

I watched his lectures and was awed by the way he had made everything seem so simple and interesting. As i started preparation late, i wasn't sure that i'd be able to watch all the videos so i only watched Youtube lectures and opted for his test series which was so helpful. Mocks were so much focused on actual gate. His motivational videos also helped me to stay positive throughout my preparation.

                    <p>Ravi sir’s videos are well made. In terms of their pace and content they are the best and subjects like OS, DBMS, Digital, Calculus, Computer Architecture, Computer Networks are too good. Since, I did not like all the subjects in the syllabus, your videos were really helpful in getting over them. Also your videos are useful for anybody to make notes of their own. The topics in a video are well oriented towards connecting concepts and hence help having a total idea. He knows the contents of the syllabus very well and always stick to it. But also you make it a point to always give something extra. And above all, the amount of motivation you flush through all the student minds is amazing and is much needed. India certainly needs lot more of your kind.</p>

                    <p>The topics tests for some subjects are really good (like TOC, Engineering mathematics, Database, Digital Design), and they did certainly help me in clearing my doubts and concepts. The test series were useful in knowing various types of questions and managing time.</p>

                        simultaneously with my Job for around 2 months I decided to give full time preparation for GATE.
                        With just 4 months of preparation from October and following Ravula Sir lectures whole heartedly
                        I was able to crack GATE in my first attempt. He is a great teacher and a perfect motivator. I
                        would highly recommend Ravula Sir lectures to anyone who is serious about cracking GATE.

                        Video lectures by Ravindra sir are so helpful , especially for someone who is starting from
                        scratch. Biggest advantage while preparing for GATE through his video lectures was the feature
                        "anytime & anywhere & any number of times". He is the BEST teacher indeed!
                        Test series provided by him was equally helpful. It helped rectifying my mistakes.

                    <p>I am Mohit Gupta. I did my B.Tech in 2010 and I have a work experience of 6+ years and I got AIR
                        306 in GATE 2017.
                        We can imagine how fundamentally strong an engineer from a normal college would be and that too
                        in times when this genius called Ravindrababu Ravula hasn't made his footprints in the teaching
                        domain. The same is the case with me. Even though a good performer in my company, I always felt
                        inside me that I don't know my subjects well. Finally I decided to prepare for GATE just to know
                        my subjects well and attempted GATE with 99% certainty of not leaving the Job. During my
                        preparation I got the chance to attend TOC class in person by Ravula sir and became a fan of him
                        and eventually registered to his videos.
                        These remarkable lectures enlightened me about what actually computer science is and now I feel
                        like reading more of computer science related stuffs than ever before. 
                        Though I won't be going for full time higher studies ( already married and blessed with a
                        beautiful daughter :) ), but GATE preparation through Ravula's videos has changed my life,
                        boosted my confidence to another level and completely changed my way of looking at things and
                        attacking problems at my work front. I wish if Ravula would have born few years earlier and I
                        had such quality videos in my college time. Anyways there is no age for learning and now I am
                        applying for part-time MS from IITD. 
                        I would recommend every engineer to prepare for GATE during their college time itself as this is
                        one of the way we get to understand our subjects well by solving previous years GATE questions
                        which are truly conceptual and helps in solidifying the concepts learnt theoretically.
                        I owe this new enlightenment in my dormant computer science professional carrier to Ravula sir

                        concepts and practicing as many questions as possible. The test series from Ravindra sir covers
                        the basics which is the heart of GATE. It helps building up the knowledge from understanding the
                        basics to implementing it to various questions and scenarios. After learning basics I have
                        focused on giving tests assuming its GATE exam and giving the GATE exam considering it another
                        test series. Apart from this stay focused and aim high and always take motivation from your

                        But I have gone through his videos and that’s all, I came to know these subjects. Ravula is a

                    <p>This is Anmol Maheshwari. I got AIR-344 in CS branch. Well at start, I was little confused about
                        which test series I should opt for. As there are many institutes that have this facility. I
                        watched some guest lectures of Ravindrababu Ravula on You Tube. And they were quite amazing. So
                        I gave it some thought and opted for GATExcel 135, a test series provided by Ravindra Babu
                        Ravula institute. The test series was excellent. It had questions which cover almost every
                        concept with various levels of difficulty. The solutions that were provided were accurate and
                        still if I had any problem, I mailed them and my problem was resolved by some IITian or IIScian
                        graduate within 24hrs. Either they would personally call me or mail me. So my overall experience
                        was amazing. And when I gave GATE, it wasn't that hard for me. As most of the questions were
                        repeated or had same concept. There was quite an improvement in my speed to solve the question.

                        Ravi Sir encouraged me to give my best in first attempt only. His lecture videos are, no doubt,
                         "the best". The simplicity with which he explained the topics made them interesting and easy to
                        grasp on. I didn’t have time to attempt all the tests in test series and on his suggestion I
                        took few Mock GATEs which really helped me to know what topics I had to brush up at last. But
                        apart from that, the support you get from Ravi Sir's team with your doubts during preparation or
                        to boost your morale when you feel demotivated is commendable. I wouldn't have done even this
                        much if I didn't have had their support.</p> 

                    <p>He is not only an amazing teacher but an outstanding motivator too. Whenever I used to feel
                        demotivated, I watch his video where he shared his story and how he overcame the difficulties
                        and became inspiration for many. That video made me believe that nothing is impossible and
                        that’s what I needed to believe in. He led the right path for me in the most crucial days of my
                        preparation by telling me what to do and what not to and I am glad to have followed his
                        advice. </p>

                    <p>My rank in Gate examination is AIR 473, all Thanks to Ravindra Sir. It is said that for succeeding in such exams, include 30% of your teacher's dedication and 70% of yours, then I would say that Sir gave his 100% out of that 30% and I gave only 20% of my hard work as I never took Gate so seriously. I was one of his YouTube fan for his teaching skills, the way he gave an in depth knowledge of the CS topics starting from basics, and then I enrolled for full course out of which I watched few subject's videos. Even without completing the syllabus or revision I got a decent rank, the whole credit goes to Sir who has the capability of planting the concepts in your brain for long time through his teaching. I also practiced few tests just days before the Gate exam and in my opinion the test series is also perfect, creating exact environment like actual exam, covering all important and potential topics with proper explanation.</p>
                        <p>I can't thank you enough Sir for keeping this journey of Gate preparation interesting for us through your academic as well as motivational lectures.

                        exam with good score but your motivation played an important role. Your way of teaching is
                        amazing so that any ordinary student like me can understand concepts easily and clearly. Also
                        the test series kept pushing my boundary each and every time. I am glad that I got a chance to

                    <p>At first I tried to avoid the preparation of gate because I was not interested , but when I got
                        to know about Ravi Sir from my senior in college, I changed my mind and joined his course.</p>
                    <p>Ravindra sir has wonderful knowledge. His GATE videos are very crisp and to the point. And if you
                        study them dedicatedly, you will surely be landing in a very good college or PSU.</p>
                    <p>I saw various notes of coaching materials (hand written) and found so much abundance of
                        unnecessary data which will never be asked in gate. But in these video data are to the
                        point.</p>
                    <p> These are few advantages that I felt after joining his course: <br>
                         1. Being online classes, you can view them anywhere at any time (Especially in college).<br>
                         2. Videos can be viewed unlimited number of times. <br>
                         3.E-mail assistance for clarification of doubts. <br>
                         4. The problem collection is another huge plus point. Especially in automata, Computer
                        Networks, DBMS, COA are extremely helpful, almost all kinds of problems are extensively solved
                        and discussed. <br>
                         5. Test-series for testing your concepts and preparation for the exam. <br>
                         6. Cost of the course is very less compared to other coaching centers. <br>

                          And Ravindra sir also provided motivational lectures from time to time and they kept me
                        motivated throughout my preparation.

                    <p>I completely devote my success to Ravindrababu Ravula. It all started when I first watched his “What to do after B.Tech” video on YouTube. I was working in Infosys & every single word he said about service based company were 100% true and I was also feeling the same working there. So, even though I did my B.E in Electronics & Communication, it inspired me to give GATE in Computer Science and follow my interest & dream to do Master’s in IISc/IIT. He teaches every single subject from scratch so that even B.E EC student can easily understand. His way of teaching is really good & you will never feel disinterested. He first explains concepts and after that he solves lot of examples on that topic, So I never had any doubts on any topic. Only thing I can say is the amount of knowledge I gained from watching his videos is far more than the knowledge i gained from my school to college days combined. I secured AIR 660 but I feel I could have done better. I could not give my 100% in those 3 hrs and made some silly mistakes in easiest questions. But I will give GATE again next year & pursue my dream.</p>

                        <p>Lastly Ravindrababu Ravula is the best teacher & mentor I have ever met.

                    <p>I have started preparing for GATE in June 2016. At that time I haven't thought that I'll
                        get such rank in first attempt only. So during preparation my aim was to just understand
                        the concepts and study them in depth. Ravindrababu sir taught me all core subjects of
                        computer science in such great manner that after completing entire syllabus my aim has changed.
                        I have followed all the tips given by sir and that helped me a lot. Sir is just 'Legend of CSE'
                        for me. He helped me to become a QUALITY Engineer...due to his teaching i had a good command on all
                        the important subjects of CSE.</p>

                        <p>The test series of all subjects was just excellent especially of Computer Networks.
                        I had given all the topic tests as well as all subject tests because of which I got used
                        to how to tackle a new problem ,how to manage time? When to leave a Q? And how you should
                            attempt paper to score your best in any competitive examination?</p>

                        <p>All subjects of computer science that I couldn't learn in 4 years, became interesting with Ravindra
                        sir's lectures which gave me a gut feeling to be a CSE student. All the required and important topics
                        for GATE has thorougly covered by sir at one place which saves a lot of time and makes it very easy
                            to crack GATE. He is really a great mentor,tutor and obviously a fitness freak.</p>

                        Actually I never really studied very seriously for GATE till my 7th semester, as I was already a
                        fan of Ravindrababu Ravula sir by watching his YouTube videos, I decided to go for his GATE 2017
                        full course. He made every subject so clear and easy and thanks to him I was understanding every
                        subject rather than mugging it up .

                    <p>I couldn't thank you enough Sir for all the support and motivation you provided through videos
                        and Emails. The moment I watched your lectures on YouTube I have decided that Masters is the
                        path I should choose in my career and it is best decision I have ever taken. You made every
                        topic clear and simple in the best possible way.
                        I'm blessed to have a teacher like you.

                    <p>First of all, I am very thankful to Ravula sir.I can say loudly and proudly that whatever concept
                        I groomed and applied it’s only because of his crystal clear videos lecture as well the total
                        GATE standard test series.</p>
                    <p>I have made few mistakes and so my rank is not very good but I can list my satisfaction with the
                        journey of gate guided by Mr. Ravula sir.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>With the concept of pointer,array,structure,linked list etc. taught by him,Now I can code very
                        fast.

Mr. Ravindrababu Ravula is certainly one of the best teachers I have had the good fortune of interacting with. Apart from a superb hold over the various topics across the spectrum of Computer science, he possesses excellent public speaking skills and is a true motivation mill. His classes are exuberant, and have a more session like flavour, giving students ample time to think on their own, something I feel is extremely conducive in developing a good understanding of the subject matter. (I don't remember anyone dozing off even during longest of his lectures). I know many students who started believing in themselves after attending his classes and went on to achieve goals they never thought were within their grasp. Interacting with him has always been a pleasure and I hope I will benefit from his association for days to come.">

His lectures on what to do on 2 months before the exam, 40 days before the exam ,30 days before the exam and how to attempt the exam were useful.

His video about Taking The Breaks is very important to every aspirant considering if I had followed it I might have not faced back pain issue I have faced. He has always been health conscious and used to take care of health of his student.I remember when he used to teach for us in classroom coaching if he felt that even single student is tired / sleepy he used used to ask all students to stand up and made us do quick workout.  His lectures are really good quality and he has made preparation easy for first time preparing students. His lectures on difficult subjects like Operating systems, Computer Networks etc. makes that subject really easy. You are doing a Great job and keep doing.">

Truly speaking, when I joined classes for GATE, I planned to get good rank so that I may get some IIT, but your motivation changed my life which inspired me to do more than getting a good rank and getting admitted in IITs. As a result I got 21st rank in GATE and joined IISc. Whenever I think of you, I am always encouraged to do something new, innovative a nd good for human beings rather than only thinking about grades and money. I found you more as a brother than just a teacher because you have not taught me only subjects rather you taught me way of life and always helped me in my all decisions. I would like to be associated with you in all phases of my life, and would like to work with you... I have a lot to say, but can't express everything in words.">

His lectures on what to do on 2 months before the exam, 40 days before the exam ,30 days before the exam and how to attempt the exam were useful. HIs lectures on Keep yourself motivated motivated me, every time I felt tired and bored and wanted to stop preparation. His video about Taking The Breaks is very important to every aspirant considering if I had followed it I might have not faced back pain issue I have faced. He has always been health conscious and used to take care of health of his student.I remember when he used to teach for us in classroom coaching if he felt that even single student is tired / sleepy he used used to ask all students to stand up and made us do quick workout.  His lectures are really good quality and he has made preparation easy for first time preparing students. His lectures on difficult subjects like Operating systems, Computer Networks etc. makes that subject really easy. You are doing a Great job and keep doing.">

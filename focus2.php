Ravindra has helped many students achieve great success with his experience. Coaching will definitely help you save lot of time and avoid lots of mistakes. You might hear some people saying that you can crack GATE with out coaching but it is estimated that nearly 20000 students are taking GATE CS after taking coaching from some coaching centres. If you are preparing only for one or two years and if you are not taking coaching, it is like running a race while others are on motor bikes. People who are suggesting that you prepare on your own are not going to take GATE on your behalf. It is your life and we suggest that you do not take any chances.

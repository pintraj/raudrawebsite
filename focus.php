                                </p>

                                <li>How many students are expected to be admitted in a batch?</li>
                                <p>We are planning to offer admission to 300 students (300 is Ravi sir's favorite

                                </li>
                                <p>The AML course attempts to teach students/course-participants some of the core ideas in machine learning, data-science and AI that would help the participants go from a real world business problem to a first cut, working and deployable ML solution to the problem. Of course, some of the high performing participants could go on to build world class solutions for real world solutions. Our primary focus is to help participants build real world ML products using the skills they learn in this course.
                                </p>
                                <li>Who are the target audience for this course?
                                </li>
                                <p>We are building our course content and teaching methodology to cater to the needs to students at various levels of expertise and varying background skills. This course can be taken by anyone with a working knowledge of a modern programming language like C/C++/Java/Python. We expect the average student to spend at least 5 hours a week over a 10 month period amounting to a 200 + hours of effort. More the effort, better the results. Here is a list of candidates who would benefit from our course:
                                <ol type="A">
                                    <li>Undergrad (BS/BTech/BE) students in engineering and science.</li>
                                    <li>Grad(MS/MTech/ME/MCA) students in engineering and science.</li>
                                    <li>Working professionals: Software engineers, Business analysts, Product managers, Program managers, Managers, Startup teams building ML products/services.</li>
                                    <li>ML Scientists and ML engineers preparing for job-interviews.</li>
                                </ol>
                                </p>
                                <li>What outcomes can each of the audience expect?
                                </li>
                                <p>We expect all of our participants to be able to go from an open ended business problem to a working, first-cut and productionizable ML solution. Undergrad/Grad students could use this course to work on their projects that would involve considerable ML components. They could also use the portfolio they build to strengthen their resume for ML engineer positions in the industry. Working professional could use this course to showcase their learnings to their peers and teams so as to move from software-engineering roles to ML engineer roles if they choose. Product managers would be able to gain a deeper understanding of ML which they can use to better design their products.

                                </p>
                                <li>What are the prerequisites for this course? When does this course begin? How long would it take?
                                </li>
                                <p>The only prerequisite for this course is a working knowledge of a modern programming language like Java/C++/Python or an ability to read pseudocode. The course will begin on June-15th, 2017. The course would be over a 10 month period.
                                </p>
                                <li>Would this course be very theoretical or practical in nature?
                                </li>
                                <p>This course will focus on practical knowledge more than mathematical or theoretical rigor. That doesn't mean that we would water down the content. We will try and balance the theory and practice while giving more preference to the practical and applied aspects of ML as the course name suggests. Through the course, we will work on 30+ case studies of real world ML problems and datasets to help students grasp the practical nuances of building ML solutions. For each idea/algorithm in ML, we would provide examples to provide the intuition and show how the idea to used in the real world.
                                </p>
                                <li>Will you give me a certificate at the completion at the end of this course?
                                </li>
                                <p>Yes, we do give a course completion certificate.  We help participants solve real world ML problems using publicly available datasets. We encourage the participants to  document their work (code, plots, models and outcomes) on github. This github profile could be used by our participants to showcase their work to their peers and potential employers. This is similar in idea to a portfolio for photographers, models, artists, designers etc. Ideally, we would love to see our participants build ML products and startups.
                                </p>
                                <li>How are you different from Coursera’s Machine learning course by Prof. Andrew Ng, Udacity’s nanodegree program etc?
                                </li>
                                <p>We love the work done by Coursera, Udacity and Udemy in this field. We are standing on their shoulders to push the horizon a little further. Following are the key differences:
                                <ol type="A">
                                    <li>AML is very applied in nature. We cover topics like posing a real world, open ended business problem into a ML problem and  machine learning process while leveraging case based teaching.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Our courses are targeted at a significantly wider audience than other courses:  every one from a 12th grade student to a ML Scientist can benefit from them. </li>
                                    <li>Our courses are hyper-personalized through ideas like Content maps(explained later) which help students learn at their own pace to reach varying degrees of expertise. This course is designed in such a way that an ML expert can revise the fundamentals using this course in just a day. This course is also designed such that someone who has no background in ML can spend 6-12 months learning all the details in depth.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Instead of giving a course completion certificate, we help our participants build a high quality portfolio to showcase their skills to potential employers.
                                    </li>
